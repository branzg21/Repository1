	<h1>Stark History</h1>
		
		<div>
The Starks are an ancient house descended from Bran the Builder, a legendary figure from the Age of Heroes said to have raised their ancestral home at Winterfell thousands of years in the past, as well as the Wall. They are descendants of the First Men and still follow some of their ancient traditions and the old gods of the forest. The Starks were Kings of Winter in the North for thousands of years from the Age of Heroes, possibly beginning with Bran the Builder. Ever since Bran constructed the Wall, the Starks have been friends of the Night's Watch, and have manned the Wall for thousands of years. The Night's King, the attainted 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, is said to have been a Stark, among his many possible origins. The Starks also helped repel several major wildling invasions, such as when they and their Umber bannermen defeated the Kings-Beyond-the-Wall like the brothers Gendel and Gorne, as well as Bael the Bard, who both sired and fought a Stark.

The ancient Starks gradually defeated rival kings, such as the Barrow Kings to their south and the Red Kings to their east. For several millennia, the Starks were not the uncontested Kings in the North, but their primary antagonists, the Boltons of the Dreadfort, swore fealty some 1,000 years ago, ending their flesh-flaying ways. Meanwhile, King Jon Stark drove pirates from the White Knife, and the Wolf's Den was built at its mouth. This stronghold was often granted to sons and grandsons of the King in the North; one such branch, the Greystarks, was extinguished after allying with the Boltons against the Starks. The Wolf's Den was eventually granted to the Manderlys, a house exiled from the Reach and taken in by the Starks. The Manderlys developed the city of White Harbor around the castle. King Jon's son, Rickard, defeated the Marsh King and married his daughter, bringing the Neck into Winterfell's realm under the lordship of House Reed. The Karstarks were founded when Karlon Stark, brother to the reigning king, helped crush a rebel lord and was granted a keep for his service. Finally, the Mormonts were granted Bear Island when King Rodrik Stark won it from the ironborn in a wrestling match. The Starks fought the Arryns of the Vale after the Rape of the Three Sisters, eventually ceding control of the islands.

Targaryen Era
The last Stark King in the North was Torrhen, who submitted to Aegon the Conqueror at the end of the War of Conquest. Since that time the Starks have held the North for the kings of the Seven Kingdoms as Wardens of the North.

In 129 AC, as the Dance of the Dragons began, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon recruited Lord Cregan Stark's aid for the blacks, known as the Pact of Ice and Fire, although the war was hoped to be short and the North judged to be too remote to be of import. After the war, Cregan briefly served as Hand of the King for King Aegon III Targaryen, a time known as the Hour of the Wolf.

Around 213 AC, House Stark faced a difficult succession. Several Lords of Winterfell had perished fighting wars in the North against rebellious Skagosi, the wildling King Raymun Redbeard and other threats, leaving Beron Stark as the lord of the house. As he too lay slowly succumbing to wounds he received fighting Dagon Greyjoy and his ironborn, his wife and four other recent Stark widows struggled over who would succeed him. There were a number of potential heirs, with some ten Stark children about.

Robert's Rebellion
Lord Rickard Stark and his maester, Walys Flowers, allegedly sought to further southron alliances by betrothing Rickard's heir, Brandon, to Catelyn Tully, the daughter of Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish, a ward at Riverrun, loved Catelyn and challenged Brandon to a duel for her hand. Brandon won their duel, but did not kill Petyr in concession to Catelyn's pleas. Meanwhile, Rickard's daughter, Lyanna Stark, was betrothed to Lord Robert Baratheon of Storm's End, who was infatuated with her from a distance. Lyanna, however, was not as ardent in her love for Robert, and was aware of his philandering ways. Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, after winning the tourney at Harrenhal, crowned Lyanna queen of love and beauty, passing over his wife, the Dornish Princess Elia Martell.

The exact nature of Lyanna's relationship with Rhaegar is not presently clear, but roughly a year thereafter she disappeared in Rhaegar's company. Robert and Brandon believed that she had been taken against her will. Brandon was on his way to Riverrun to wed Catelyn when he heard the news of Lyanna's disappearance. He and four companions rode to King's Landing to seek her return, and Brandon shouted for Rhaegar to "come out and die" when he reached the gates of the Red Keep. The crown price was not present, but King Aerys II Targaryen did order the arrest of Brandon and summon Lord Rickard in response. Rickard and Brandon were both executed on the order of the Mad King. It is currently unknown whether and when Lyanna learned about this, and how she responded. Aerys, after the two executions, demanded the heads of Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon from their former foster father, Lord Jon Arryn of the Eyrie. Jon refused, however, and raised his banners in revolt. This was the beginning of Robert's Rebellion.

During its course, Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark honored his late brother Brandon's betrothal to Catelyn Tully as part of an alliance to bring House Tully into the rebel fold. Ned was one of the principal commanders in the war, but had a falling out with Robert after he accepted the treacherous aid of House Lannister and condoned the brutal murders of Rhaegar's wife, daughter and son out of his hatred for the Targaryen crown prince. After the Sack of King's Landing, Eddard rode south to relieve the siege of Storm's End. Afterwards, Eddard and six companions went to retrieve Lyanna at the fortress Rhaegar had named the tower of joy. They fought three Kingsguard knights stationed there, who killed all but Eddard and Howland Reed. Eddard found Lyanna dying in a bed of blood, clutching rose petals, dead and black, in her palm. She forced him to make a promise to her, the contents of which are unknown, but which have haunted Eddard since. Although Ned and Robert were reconciled in their shared grief, Ned disdained the court since Robert, the new king, married Cersei Lannister and allowed her brother, Ser Jaime, to remain in the Kingsguard even after slaying his liege, Aerys II.

Ned returned from the war to be presented with his trueborn son, Robb, but he carried the infant Jon Snow, whom he presented as his bastard son. Lyanna was buried in the crypt of Winterfell beside her father, Rickard, and brother, Brandon. Six years later, Ned helped his foster brother, King Robert I, crush Balon Greyjoy's rebellion, taking Theon Greyjoy as a ward of Winterfell. Lord Rickard's youngest child, Benjen, joined the Night's Watch, eventually becoming First Ranger. Eddard has ruled the North in Robert's name, keeping a distance from the intrigue-ridden politics of King's Landing.</div>
